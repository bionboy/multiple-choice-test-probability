Solution for the first question of HW4 in [CSE-622] Simulations and Discrete Systems

## Prompt

In an interview, a human resource (HR) specialist asks candidates 20 questions with 5 possible multiple choice answers to each question.
What is the probability of the following candidates for success given the following assumptions:

 1. HR has the last answer always correct, candidates select answers at random.
 2. HRâ€™s solution is in a random location and student selects an answer at random.
 
Note:
Assume the interview has only 3 questions, trace some (approx. 10) random candidates for each scenario but run a larger sample on the computer and do not respond philosophically without support.
